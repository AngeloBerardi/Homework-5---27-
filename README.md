# Homework5  #27
Group #27 composed by Angelo Berardi, Guglielmo Lato, Inar Azimov 
Hello guys, so the work has been splitted in this way:

Angelo Berardi has done GitHub, main.py, function 3 and 4

Guglielmo Lato has done whole third part, so Visualization 1, 2, 3 and 4

Inar Azimov has done function 1 and 2

The repository has:

_func_1.py:_ 
  >It includes function 1 and visualization 1.
  
_func_2.py:_ 
  >It includes function 2 and visualization 2.
  
_func_3.py:_ 
  >it includes function 3 and visualization 3.
  
_func_4.py:_ 
  >It includes function 4 and visualization 4.
  
_main.py:_ 
>That executes the whole homework, asking you the function that you want to use, the starting point and also the list of points.

We hope that you will find interesting how we have done the homework!

See you the day of the exam,

Angelo, Guglielmo and Inar
